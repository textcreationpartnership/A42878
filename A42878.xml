            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>♏ aſcends which is cold, and inclining to Melancholly, the <hi>Sun</hi> is in ♍ an earthy melancholy Sign; and the <hi>Moon,</hi> who is

            <p>BY the <hi>Qualities</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> I mean the effluviums of the ſenſitive Appetite and rational Soul, from the firſt of which are produced thoſe two natural Principles of Luſt and Anger, Love and Hate, and all other ſenſible Effects of the ſenſitive Appetite, to which is joined the Rational Soul, the very <hi>ipſa hominis forma Informans,</hi> by which we are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from bruits, and is thought by ſome to have an intrinſick Plaſtick virtue to nouriſh the Embrio in the Womb.</p>

Secondly, the Will, which is neither meerly paſſive nor meerly active, but is agitated either by Object or Thought; and it hath alſo a kind of a blind power, for it deſires nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be propoſed to it by the Intellect; hence that ſaying; <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> The Operations and Eſſluviums of this ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and rational Soul, with its Faculties and Properties, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Engliſh the Mind, and is a perfect Compriſal of the whole Man, or rather the <hi>theſaurus animae,</hi> collecting beams and rays from all parts of the ſenſe and ſoul, and doth either improve them by Vertue, or miſ-improve them by Vice, according to the Poſition of the Luminaries with the benefick or maleſick Stars in the Radix or Nativity, and is our next buſineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But perhaps ſome may ſay he hath a bad profectional Figure for this year, he now having ♐ in his Horoſcope (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Radical place of ♂) and the Radical place of ☿ cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, in his <hi>Medium Coeli,</hi> which I own to be an unhappy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to carry a ſufficient tendency of ill, were there other ſequel Cauſes for the ſame; but Profections are rather Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Effects of Directions, than particular Cauſes of any ſuch things themſelves; but I leave thoſe things to thoſe who are more curious.</p>
            <p>I do think this Native may in a courſe of Nature live till the Sun, who is Giver of life, comes to the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of <hi>Venus,</hi> who is Lady of the ſeventh Houſe in the Radix and to the ſquare
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47400:15"/>of the Moon, who hath Dignities in that Houſe alſo, and at the ſame time the Aſcendant comes to the ſquare of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Lord of his Eighth Houſe, and to the body of <hi>Mars</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, without latitude, as may be ſeen by the Table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections preceeding; and this will happen about the fifty fourth or fifty fifth year of his age. And thus much for this Nativity.</p>

            <p>There have been more Directions in force, but becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo happy as to hear of the Accident attending them, I ſhall forbear their Operations, and give the Reader an account when they happened, that others when they know them may apply them to their proper Cauſes and Effects; aged about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, he had the Sun directed to the body of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which Direction could not chuſe but be dangerous to his life.</p>
            <p>Aged about 12 or 13, he had his Horoſcope to the ☍ of <hi>Mars cum Lat.</hi> this could give no durable diſeaſe, becauſe it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Rays of the ⚹ of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ♄ and ♂ were in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> at his birth, yet it would give ſome ſlight Feaver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he ſhall be aged 21 years, his Sun comes by Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſquare of the Moon in <hi>Sagitary;</hi> this will be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Direction, and will give either the ſmall Pox, or a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or both.</p>
            <p>Aged near 25, his Horoſcope comes to the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of the Sun in ♒, a place the Sun hates, this is uſually a troubleſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous direction, and doth as well concern the honour as the life of the Native, and his Father.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47400:18"/>
            <p> But ſeeing Directions work according to the Quality of the perſons paſſive in their Effects, and becauſe I am not ſure that this Horoſcope is certainly true (although I dare be confident it is not far off from the true one) I will omit all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this nature, and come to ſpeak to things more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>In this Nativity the Sun is Giver of Life, and <hi>Mars</hi> Giver of Years, from whence we may judge that this Native may live to a conſiderable age: and as <hi>Mars</hi> caſteth his Trine to <hi>Saturn,</hi> Lord of the Aſcendant, and the Sun caſteth his ⚹ to the Degree aſcending, he may be generally very healthful; to which we may add the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> of the Sun and Moon, <hi>Saturn,</hi> Lord of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to <hi>Mars</hi> in the ſeventh, and the Sun, Lord of the eighth, in Trine to the Moon in the ſecond, and ☿ who hath Dignities in the eighth, is likewiſe in the tenth Houſe, ſhew him to advance his Fortune by Marriage, and that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably marry thrice, if not four times, becauſe the Moon, Lady of the ſeventh, is in ♓, the Dignities of <hi>Venus</hi> a fruitful Sign, and ♂ in the ſeventh in ♋, a fruitful Sign, and the Sun and <hi>Saturn</hi> Lord of the Aſcendant in ♏ in the tenth Houſe, the prime angle of the Figure, and a fruitful Sign alſo. It is generally reported, that this Native is of a very moroſe nature, which is well ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ♂, who hath Dignities in the Horoſcope in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to ♃, the Author of Clemency and good Nature, and the Moon in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to <hi>Saturn,</hi> Lord of the Aſcendant, may very aptly ſignifie the ſame, eſpecially if we conſider the fixed Stars that the Sun is with, and ☿ the general ſignificator of the mind is with the like fixed Stars, and combuſt of the Sun, and in Aſpect neither to ♃ nor ♀.</p>
            <p>That his death will be natural, is viſible by the Moons <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to the Sun and ♃, and ♂ his <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to ♄ Lord of the Aſcendant, and that he will dye of a Dropſical or a Hypochondriacal Diſtemper, becauſe ☿ Lord of the ſixth and eighth is in <hi>Scorpio</hi> combuſt, and <hi>Saturn</hi> Lord of the Aſcendant, and the Moon in watery Signs.</p>
            <p>The Sun in the tenth ſhews he will be famous and honourable at ſometimes, and that in his own Country too, for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47400:18"/>will not be eminent abroad, although he will have an aſpiring undertaking ſpirit, and aiming at great things.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Saturn</hi> in the tenth (although Lord of the Horoſcope) in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to the Moon in the ſecond, will in the latter part of his life give him ſome unhappy Accident and Cataſtrophe to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and this is confirmed by ♂ Lord of the tenth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to ♃ in the ninth: why may not the Clergy oppoſe his honour and greatneſs, or ſome Religious War begin again in <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Venus</hi> Lady of the ninth is in Reception with ♃, and he his real Enemy.</p>
